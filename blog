Cartpole

1. Instability Issues
    - Tried to stop training once a good score was found
        Network learned a rather unstable version where it always performed rather well but never completely learned to balance the pole for ever
        Average score of about 380


    - Tried to learn with a very small learning rate and a huge memory size to have a big variaty of states and a slow convergence
        Ended up with a average score of about 150 with a rather unstable behaviour sometimes resulting in scores below 100


    - Implementing a target network wich is only updated after a x timesteps to predict the future q value
